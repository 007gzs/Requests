Goals
=====

1. **Simple interface**

   Requests is designed to provide a simple, unified interface to making
   requests, regardless of what is available on the system.

2. **Fully tested code**

   Requests always has 90%+ code coverage from the unit tests and strives for
   100% coverage.

   (Note: some parts of the code are not covered by design. These sections are
   marked with `@codeCoverageIgnore` tags)
